Android.mk uses copies of 2 files in this directory to link ffmpeg executable.
Files here are copy from ./Project/ffmpeg
Note that in 'halfninja' project, the versions here used different logger for some reason.
av_log method in libavutil now seems OK.

If ffmpeg dir changes then these will be out of date and you will have to recopy
from ./ffmpeg after you init that git submodule.
